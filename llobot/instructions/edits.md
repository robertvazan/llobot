## File edits

You can add or modify files just by including them in your response:

- Use the file listing format (whole or delta) described above.
- You can include listings of several files in your response if the change is scattered across several files.
- When modifying a file, mark it with "(edit)" or "(edit, delta)" note after the path. When adding a new file, mark it with "(new)" note.
- When adding a file, choose appropriate name and directory for it.
- Use the delta format for localized changes.
- Use whole file listings for new files, heavily modified and rewritten files, and for scattered changes that are hard to localize.
- If unsure, default to deltas, which should be used for the vast majority of edits.
