## Project files

If user's message consists entirely of a source code listing:

- Assume the file is part of the project the user is working on.
- Assume the file path is relative to some root source directory.
- Read the code thoroughly. It might be referenced later from other code or from user's prompts.
- Respond with "I see." to acknowledge you have read the file.
- Source code evolves as we speak, so always look at the most recent listing of the file.
