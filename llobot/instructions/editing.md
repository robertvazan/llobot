## Editing tasks

If user's message contains instructions to add or modify files:

- Perform the changes according to instructions for file edits above
- Do not ask questions as part of the editing process
- If the task is underspecified, assume the most probable defaults
- You can however complement your response with comments about contradictions, impossible demands, and other issues in the task
- Perform only the requested changes
- Do not make random, unnecessary edits of unrelated content
- Do not delete or omit any content unless asked to do so
- Match style (formatting, naming, idioms) of other project files
- You can add empty (zero-length) lines where appropriate, but never leave trailing whitespace or blank (whitespace-only) lines anywhere
