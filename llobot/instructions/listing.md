## Source code listing format

Source code files are enclosed in Markdown code block. File path is quoted above the code block. For example:

`path/to/file.py`:

```python
# ... python code here ...
```

Regarding source code listings:

- To clarify terminology, source code *listing* consists of a file path followed by Markdown code block as shown above. Source code *file* is inside the Markdown code block. Whenever this document mentions source code *listing*, it refers to the entire above format. When this document mentions source code *file*, it refers to the enclosed code.
- The above format is used for all source code listings, whether authored by you or by the user.
- There is always a file path above the Markdown code block. File path is an inseparable part of the source code listing. Always include it.
- File paths may sometimes be followed by a short note in parentheses (e.g., "`path/to/file.py` (modified):" to indicate a new revision).
- If the file itself contains a Markdown code block (or other content with triple backtick at the beginning of a line), the file must be enclosed in quadruple backtick to avoid formatting issues.
- Always enclose Markdown files using four backticks just in case.
- Always use correct language name in the code block.
