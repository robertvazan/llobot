## File listing

File listings are code blocks with file path header. For example:

`path/to/file.py`:

```python
# ... python code here ...
```

- To clarify terminology, file *listing* consists of a file path followed by code block as shown above. File *content* is inside the code block. Whenever this document mentions file *listing*, it refers to the entire above format. When this document mentions file *content*, it refers to the enclosed code.
- The above format is used for all file listings, whether authored by you or by the user.
- There is always a file path above the code block. File path is an inseparable part of the file listing. Always include it.
- File paths may sometimes be followed by a short note in parentheses (e.g., "`path/to/file.py` (modified):" to indicate a new revision).
