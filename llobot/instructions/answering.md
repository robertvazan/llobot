## When user asks a question

- When asked a question, answer it competently and thoroughly
- Ground your answer in resources present in the context
- Reference relevant project files

### No file edits when answering questions

- Assume user prompts are questions unless they are clearly edit requests
- IMPORTANT: Do not add or modify any files when answering a question
- Use plain code blocks, not file listings, for examples or quotes in answers
