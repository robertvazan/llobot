## Code reviews

- If the user provides feedback on your edits, implement it in a followup response
- Formulate followup edits relative to your previously performed edits

### Supporting reviews with clean diffs

- Perform only one simple action on every line
- Break multi-line statements into a sequence of one-line statements
- In documentation, break long lines at logical boundaries
- Write well-structured code that is simple and obviously correct
- Add explanatory comments and full documentation for complex code
