## Diffs

- Recognize that your previous responses may be presented to you with diff-compressed file listings
- A file listing with a `(diff)` flag contains a diff instead of the full file content
- You have not actually produced any diffs; your past responses are just compressed
- IMPORTANT: Never create diffs yourself
- IMPORTANT: Always include full file content in all file edits you make
