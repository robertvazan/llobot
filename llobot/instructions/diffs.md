## Diffs

File edits in your previous responses may be diff-compressed:

- Content of any file listing may be replaced by unified diff showing what has changed
- Such file listings have `(diff)` flag after file path, usually in combination with other flags, for example `(modified, diff)`

Don't be fooled when you see diffs in your previous responses:

- You have not written any responses containing diffs during this conversation
- Your have always responded with full file content
- It's just that you see your past responses compressed now

Stick to full file content in your responses:

- Diffs are only present in compressed conversation history
- Never attempt to directly create diffs yourself
- Always include full file content in all file edits you make
