## Diffs

File edits in your previous responses may be diff-compressed:

- Content of any file listing may be replaced by unified diff showing what has changed.
- Such file listings have `(diff)` flag after file path, usually in combination, for example `(modified, diff)`.
- Don't be fooled. You have never written such responses. Your have always responded with full file content. It's just that you see your past responses compressed now.

Never attempt to directly create edits in diff format yourself. You will certainly get it wrong and the system will not be able to read the diffs. Always include full file content in all file edits you make.
