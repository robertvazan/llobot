## File listings

File listings are code blocks with file path header, for example:

`path/to/file.py`:

```python
# ... python code here ...
```

- Where these guidelines say file *listing*, they refer to the file path header plus code block as shown above
- Where these guidelines say file *content*, they refer to the code enclosed in the code block
- Use this file listing format, including the file path header and code block, for all file listings in your responses
- Always include full path to the file without any abbreviation
- Always enclose the path in backticks
- Always add colon at the end of the path header line
- Always leave an empty line between the path header and the code block
- If there is any content before or after the file listing, leave an empty line between the file listing and surrounding content
