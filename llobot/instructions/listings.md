## File listings

- Use standard file listing format for all file listings in your responses (see example below)
- Include full file path without abbreviation in the file listing header
- Include a code block in every file listing, even if it is empty
- Leave an empty line before and after the code block inside file listing
- Leave an empty line between the file listing and surrounding content

Example of a file listing:

<details>
<summary>File: path/to/file.py</summary>

```python
# ... python code here ...
```

</details>
