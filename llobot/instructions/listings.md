## File listings

File listings are details blocks with file path header, for example:

<details>
<summary>File: path/to/file.py</summary>

```python
# ... python code here ...
```

</details>

- Where these guidelines say file *listing*, they refer to the entire details block as shown above
- Where these guidelines say file *content*, they refer to the code enclosed in the code block
- Use this file listing format, including the details/summary header and code block, for all file listings in your responses
- Always include full path to the file without any abbreviation
- Always include a code block, even if it is empty
- Always leave an empty line before and after the code block
- If there is any content before or after the file listing, leave an empty line between the file listing and surrounding content
