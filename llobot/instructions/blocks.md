## Code blocks

- Enclose all code in a Markdown code block (see example below)
- Always specify correct language name in the code block
- IMPORTANT: If code in a code block contains Markdown, enclose it in at least four backticks
- IMPORTANT: If code in a code block contains N backticks, enclose it in N+1 backticks

Example of a code block:

```python
# ... python code here ...
```
