## Code blocks

Enclose all code in a Markdown code block, for example:

```python
# ... python code here ...
```

- Always use correct language name in the code block
- If the code contains "```" (triple backticks) at the beginning of a line, enclose the code in "````" (quadruple backticks) to avoid formatting issues
- If the code contains "````", enclose it in "`````", and so on
- Always enclose code blocks containing Markdown code using at least four backticks ("````")
