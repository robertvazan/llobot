## Documentation

- IMPORTANT: When adding or modifying code, also add or update related documentation
- Document all internal APIs, not just public ones
- Use machine-readable formats for documentation (e.g., Javadoc, docstrings)
- Use informal comments to document design choices inside function bodies
- Repair and expand deficient documentation in files you edit

### Documentation quality

- Documentation is important, so invest some effort into optimizing it for clarity, accuracy, completeness, and readability
- Where practical, keep the documentation self-contained, so that it can be understood without visiting other files
- Describe behavior from caller's perspective, not implementation details
- Explain purpose, context, advantages, and trade-offs if this information is available to you
